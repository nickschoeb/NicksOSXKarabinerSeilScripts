# NicksOSXKarabinerSeilScripts
My Karabiner scripts and Seil settings for OS X

Get the Karabiner software at https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/
Get the Seil software at https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en

Set Seil to change the caps lock key to keycode 62
Set keyboard to no action on caps lock in OS X prefs
Use the private.xml for Karabiner

What it does: This disables your caps lock key and [caps lock + { W, A, S, D }] become arrow keys
Why?: I like this method of navigation in text editors sometimes and I dislike the caps lock key
